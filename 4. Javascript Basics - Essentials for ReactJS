Javascript Basics
-Javascript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which compiles at runtime.
-Executed as a part of webpage in the browser or on any host environment.
-Created to make webpages more dynamic(manipulating DOM and implementing many other functionalities)

-Javascript is an event-driven programming language.
-Javascript is synchronous single threaded language.

Javascript Data Types
-Primitive Data Type: Single simple data value with no additional properties:
--String: Ex: let userName = 'Sripad';
--Number: Ex: let actionType = 10;
--Boolean: Ex: let isAction = true;
--Undefined: Ex: let hasAction = undefined;
-Complex Data Type: May have additional properties and/or method(s):
--Boject: Ex: let actionProperties = { key: 'value'};
--Function: 
Ex: let executeAction = function() {
    console.log('Something')'
}
-We can make use of 'typeof' operator to check the data type of Javascript variable.
